/**
 * Feature flags — single source of truth for which surfaces are live.
 *
 * Stage 1 / MVP scope (per exports/ARK_PDD_MVP_Spartan.md):
 *   - ON  : the 7 CLASS A surfaces (Identity, Resume Analyzer, CCGE Arena,
 *           SPHINX MVP, Bonsai onboarding, Billing FREE+PRO, GDPR) PLUS every
 *           CLASS C surface — all deferred modules have been activated.
 *   - OFF : none. (Flip any flag OFF via env if a trigger needs to be gated
 *           again; see Part 4 of the MVP PDD for trigger families.)
 *
 * Server-side: read via `isFeatureEnabled(key)` from `server/featureFlags.ts`.
 *              Gate routes with the `requireFeature(key)` middleware — flagged
 *              routes return 404 (not 403) so they're indistinguishable from
 *              unimplemented endpoints.
 *
 * Client-side: import `FEATURES` directly. Hide nav items and gate routes;
 *              flagged routes should render the 404 page so the URL behaves
 *              exactly like the server thinks it does.
 *
 * Override mechanism (server only): set env `FEATURE_<key>=true|false` to
 * flip without a redeploy (e.g. `FEATURE_COHORTS=true`). The client reads the
 * static defaults below at build time — flip a client-visible flag by editing
 * this file and rebuilding.
